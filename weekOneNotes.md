# Git and markdown

## Git

I did not learn too much about git, I have used it at work and other classes before. But it was a nice refresher.

## Markdown

I did not know that a markdown was a thing. That is cool. It is like documentation. Documenting what I learned and the functionality of the code. It can be a handy resource.
