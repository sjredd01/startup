# Defend the Cities

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a nostaligic trip back to 1980's arcade games.
Specifically an acarde game called Space Invaders. This is just a simple game where
you control a movable cannon where you shot descending aliens that can shoot back. As the cannon you are defending five cities. if the aliens destroy the cities or the aliens shoot you, you loose. the goal of the game is to survive as long as you can and get the high score.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will be using HTML structure for the application. The application will have three pages. A login page, a high score page and a game play page.
- **CSS** - This technology will be used to make sure the application can be played well on many different screen sizes. Alos will be used to animate the movemnt of the aliens and the user. Animate the shots and the cities being defended.
- **React** - I will use react to handling the players key inputs and have it translate to animation. Also to build the ui for login in and registering a user and the state managment of the gameplay. Changeing how the ui looks with key presses and animations.
- **Service** - The backend will have endpoints for login, saving highscores, retriving previous scores. And a public api EmojiHub to get an emoji of an explosion and have it pop up at times.
- **DB/Login** - The DB will store the users and their personal high scores. All top 20 high scores of all time. The login information for the users. And all previous scores from a player. Register and login users.
- **WebSocket** - Live score updates and user names will be broadcasted to all users who are playing a game.
