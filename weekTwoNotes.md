# AWS

## DNS

I learned about buying a dns and more AWS stuff. I think it is so cool that I have a website. I learned that the \* is a catch all that covers anything unless already recorded. Honestly AWS is such a cool tool and is super powerful. I am only scratching the surface but it is awwesome. Also I can add as many records and connecting them to different servers and other places.

## Terminal

I did a lot of stuff in the terminal and figuring out my computures built in protections. Honestly kinda annoying but thats Apple for you. But I was able to do everything.

## HTTPS

I learned that we can actually change our server and use caddy to make it more secure. It was fun to ssh into it and change it manually. I liked it.
